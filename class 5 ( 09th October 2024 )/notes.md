Topic: Destructuring
Destructuring allows you to easily extract properties from objects or arrays and assign them to variables, making code cleaner and more readable.

Object Destructuring:
When you need specific properties from an object, rather than accessing them individually with the dot notation (e.g., object.property), you can destructure the object to get direct access to its properties.

const person = { name: "Ali", age: 30, job: "Engineer" };

// Traditional way
const name = person.name;
const age = person.age;

// Using destructuring
const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name); // "Ali"
console.log(age);  // 30

Why Use Destructuring? It simplifies code, especially when working with complex data structures.
Real-World Scenario: Imagine you get an employee's data from a database response containing many details. Destructuring lets you pick only the details you need (like name and department) without manually writing each property.

Components in Web Development:
Components are reusable pieces of code in frameworks like React and Next.js, allowing you to build parts of your app separately and use them multiple times. They can be rendered on the Client Side or Server Side.

Client-Side Rendering (CSR):
Definition: Rendering on the client's browser.

When to Use: When you want interactive or dynamic content that relies on JavaScript.

How to Make a Component Client-Side: Add "use client" at the top of the component. This tells the system it's a client component and allows the use of hooks like useState.

Example:

"use client";
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}

Real-World Example: Think of a shopping cart where items and quantities update in real time. The cart component can be a client component, updating the user’s view instantly.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR):
Definition: Rendering on the server before sending the content to the client.

When to Use: When data needs to be fetched and rendered on the server (like user profile data).

Default Behavior: Components are server-side by default, so they don’t have access to hooks like useState. If you want the component to be server-rendered, just don’t add "use client".

Example:

// No "use client" at the top, so this is a server-side component
export default function ServerComponent() {
    // This is typically for fetching and displaying data
    return <div>Server-rendered content here</div>;
}

Real-World Example: A blog homepage where articles are loaded from a database on the server, ensuring users get the content quickly without needing to wait for it to load dynamically.

Key Differences:
Client-Side: Interactive, uses JavaScript in the browser, and requires "use client".
Server-Side: Default behavior, no JavaScript interactions, often used for pre-rendering content.
